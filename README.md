Water and beach monitoring
## Tidal Info
Wrote a python script that calls the tidal and weather API. Currently writing functions that will calculate the level of risk for each measurement. 
## Risks
Wind - how strong the wind is determines the risk.
Temp - the colder the temp the higher the risk.
Tide - the difference between the tides determines the level of risk.
