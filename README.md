# Water and Beach Monitoring

## Overview

This project involves monitoring water and beach conditions using various data sources and machine learning models.

## Tidal Info

We developed a Python script that interacts with tidal and weather APIs. Currently, we are working on functions to calculate the level of risk for each measurement.

### Risks

-   **Wind**: The strength of the wind determines the risk.
-   **Temperature**: Colder temperatures increase the risk.
-   **Tide**: The difference between the tides determines the level of risk.

## Swimmer Detection

We created a model using YOLOv8n as a base to detect humans and swimmers.

## Future Work

-   Enhance the risk calculation functions.
-   Improve the accuracy of the swimmer detection model.
-   Integrate additional data sources for more comprehensive monitoring.
-   Have areas of priority

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the Python script for tidal info.
4. Use the YOLOv8n model for swimmer detection.
