Water and beach monitoring

## Tidal Info

Wrote a python script that calls the tidal and weather API. Currently writing functions that will calculate the level of risk for each measurement.

### Risks

Wind - how strong the wind is determines the risk.
Temp - the colder the temp the higher the risk.
Tide - the difference between the tides determines the level of risk.

## Swimmer detetcion

Made a model using yolov8n as a base to detect humans and swimmers
